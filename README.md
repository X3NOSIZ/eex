# eex - eexperiments

> Collection of tiny *eexperiments* built with web technologies.

Go ahead and visit the [project site](http://tofuness.github.io/eex/) if you haven't! I will try my best to regularly add new things to the repo
and keep it interesting. Looking forward to learning lots of awesome things this year :goat:

## Notes

Ideally, all experiments should stay small and easily accessible. In other words, keep dependency bloat to a minimum. The goal is to inspire both *you* and me to build new *interesting* stuff for the web.

## Install

Clone the repo. Everything should run in the browser. Report any problems through the issue tracker.
