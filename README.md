## ..eex?

eex is a growing collection of creative code experiments built using web technologies such as Canvas. I will try my best to regularly add new *eexperiments* to the repo and keep things interesting. Looking forward to learning lots of awesome things this year :goat:

Go ahead and visit the [project site](http://tofuness.github.io/eex/) if you haven't!

## Notes

Ideally, all experiments should stay small and easily accessible. In other words, keep dependency bloat to a minimum. Most experiments were built using [Pt.js](https://github.com/williamngan/pt). Feel free to send in any PRs.

## Install

Clone the repo. Everything should run in the browser. Report any problems through the issue tracker.
